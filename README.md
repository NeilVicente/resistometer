# Resistometer

## Overview
This is a web app that identifies the color bands on a resistor from a photo and calculates the resistance value. The app uses JavaScript for image processing and color recognition, allowing users to upload a photo of a resistor, detect the color bands, and get the corresponding resistance value without requiring any backend services.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload a photo of a resistor to the app.
- **Color Band Detection**: The app analyzes the image to identify the color bands on the resistor.
- **Resistance Calculation**: Based on the detected colors, the app calculates the resistance value of the resistor.
- **Real-Time Processing**: The app runs entirely in the browser, ensuring quick and efficient results.
